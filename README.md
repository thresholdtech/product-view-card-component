# product-view-card-component

hi guys, this is the fifth project that I made.
This is from Frontend mentor. Perfume Web.
This project includes HTML & CSS
I made this project by using grid to divide the image and text.
Also use two images for desktop and mobile view
Media query is used to change the look of the website based on the viewport.
